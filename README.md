# Topic Modeling Using LDA Algorithm on COVID-19 Dataset

This repository contains the code and analysis for performing topic modeling on a COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. The goal of this project is to uncover hidden topics within the dataset, which can help in understanding the prevalent themes and trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes various articles, reports, and research papers related to COVID-19. It contains text data that provides rich information about different aspects of the pandemic, such as its impact on health, economy, and society.

## Project Overview

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
2. **Tokenization and Lemmatization**: Breaking down text into tokens and lemmatizing to reduce words to their base forms.
3. **Vectorization**: Converting text data into a format suitable for LDA.
4. **LDA Model Training**: Applying the LDA algorithm to discover latent topics.

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Gensim
- NLTK


### Repository Structure:
- `notebooks/`: Kaggle notebooks with step-by-step code and analysis.
- `src/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-lda-topic-modeling.git
    ```
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   

## Results

The project successfully identifies and visualizes various topics within the COVID-19 dataset, providing insights into the key themes discussed in the documents. The LDA model helps in understanding the distribution of topics across different documents and the significance of each topic.
